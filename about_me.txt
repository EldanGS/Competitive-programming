You are welcome in my GH,
Today its the first day of summer training competetive programming ACM.
In this page: "2017 summer training ACM", I'll consider some problems from site likes: codeforces.com, spoj.com, acm.timus.ru, hackerrank.com and etc.
Maybe in the first time, I solve the problems in "russian" language. For upgrade some mistake on knowledge, but I'll try to translate in english and proof that.
Ok guys, have a nice programming.
