You are welcome in my GH,
Today its the first day of summer training of competetive programming ACM.
In this page: "2017 summer training ACM", I'll consider some problems from sites likes: codeforces.com, spoj.com, acm.timus.ru, hackerrank.com and so on.
Maybe in the first time, I solve the problems in "russian" language. To get some basic experience and knowledge in ACM, but I'll try to translate in english and proof that.
Ok guys, I'll start and for you I could be say: have a nice programming.
