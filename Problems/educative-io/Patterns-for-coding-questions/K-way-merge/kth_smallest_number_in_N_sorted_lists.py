"""
Given â€˜Mâ€™ sorted arrays, find the Kâ€™th smallest number among all the arrays.

Example 1:
Input: L1=[2, 6, 8], L2=[3, 6, 7], L3=[1, 3, 4], K=5
Output: 4
Explanation: The 5th smallest number among all the arrays is 4, this can be verified from the merged
list of all the arrays: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8]

Example 2:
Input: L1=[5, 8, 9], L2=[1, 7], K=3
Output: 7
Explanation: The 3rd smallest number among all the arrays is 7.
