* * # Step 1
Throughout this interview, we'll pretend we're building a new * analytical
database. Don't worry about actually building a database though â€“ * these
will all be toy problems. * * Here's how the database works: all records are
represented as maps, with * string keys and integer values. The records are
contained in an array, in no * particular order. *

* To begin with, the database will support just one function: min_by_key.
This * function scans the array of records and returns the record that has
the * minimum value for a specified key. Records that do not contain the
specified * key are considered to have value 0 for the key. Note that keys
may map to * negative values! *

* Here's an example use case: each of your records contains data about a
school * student. You can use min_by_key to answer questions such as "who is
the * youngest student?" and "who is the student with the lowest grade-point
* average?" * * Implementation notes: You should handle an empty array of
records in an * idiomatic way in your language of choice. If several records
share the same * minimum value for the chosen key, you may return any of
them. * * ### Java function signature: ``` public static Map<String, Integer>
* minByKey(String key, List<Map<String, Integer>> records); ``` * *


### Examples (in Python): ```
assert min_by_key("a", [{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a": * 2}]) == {"a": 1, "b": 2}
assert min_by_key("a", [{"a": 2}, {"a": 1, "b": 2}]) * == {"a": 1, "b": 2}
assert min_by_key("b", [{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a": 2}]) == * {"a": 2}
assert min_by_key("a", [{}]) == {}
assert min_by_key("b", [{"a": * -1}, {"b": -1}]) == {"b": -1} ``` */



* * # Step 2: first_by_key Our next step in database development is to add a new
function. We'll call this function first_by_key. It has much in common with
min_by_key. first_by_key takes three arguments: a string key a string sort
direction (which must be either "asc" or "desc") an array of records, just as
in min_by_key. If the sort direction is "asc", then we should return the
minimum record, otherwise we should return the maximum record. As before,
records without a value for the key should be treated as having value 0. Once
you have a working solution, you should re-implement min_by_key in terms of
first_by_key .


* * # Step 3: first_by_key comparator As we build increasingly rich orderings
for our records, we'll find it useful to extract the comparison of records into
a comparator. This is a function or object (depending on your language) which
determines if a record is "less than", equal, or "greater than" another.
In object-oriented languages, you should write a class whose constructor accepts
two parameters: a string key and a string direction. The class should implement
a method compare that takes as its parameters two records. This method should
return -1 if the first record comes before the second record (according to key
and direction), zero if neither record comes before the other, or 1 if the first
record comes after the second. In functional languages, you should write a
function which accepts two parameters: a string key and a string direction. The
function should return a method that takes as its parameters two records. This
function should return -1 if the first record comes before the second record
(according to key and direction), zero if neither record comes before the other,
or 1 if the first record comes after the second. You should then use your
comparator in your implementation of first_by_key.
