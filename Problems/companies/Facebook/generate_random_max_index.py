"""
Generate random max index

Given an array of integers, randomly return an index of the maximum value seen by far.

e.g.
Given [11,30,2,30,30,30,6,2,62,62]

Having iterated up to the at element index 5 (where the last 30 is),
randomly give an index among [1, 3, 4, 5] which are indices of 30 - the max value by far.
Each index should have a Â¼ chance to get picked.

Having iterated through the entire array, randomly give an index between 8 and 9 which are indices of the max value 62.
